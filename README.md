# StatApp
Econometrics and applied statistics project conducted under the supervision of Benjamin Gilbert (INSEE) with Manon Maugard, Sacha Nass and Claire Du Campe de Rosamel for the StatApp mandatory project from November 2024 to May 2025 (second year of engineering cycle at ENSAE IP Paris). 

**Subject : Analysis of the determinants of promotions in the french civil service.**

**Motivations** : The aim of this project is to focus on the career paths of civil servants (in France), to characterize them and to draw up a portrait of the measurable elements that play a role in whether or not they are promoted. Particular attention will be paid to socio-demographic variables (gender, age, place of residence).

**Methodology** : Career trajectories of individuals from certain State civil service corps between 1980 and 1989, and compare these trajectories with the various socio-demographic variables and job characteristics available. Survival models can be used to model the determinants of waiting time before a promotion and clustering methods and Oaxaca-Blinder decomposition to understand different career profiles.

**Databases** : Files providing exhaustive and individual-level data on the employment and remuneration characteristics of civil servants in the French State civil service :
  - FGE (Fichiers généraux de l'Etat - general state files, Insee)
  - Siasp (Insee)

The report and summary sheet are currently only available in French.
