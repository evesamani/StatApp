# StatApp
Econometrics and applied statistics project conducted under the supervision of Benjamin Gilbert (INSEE) with Manon Maugard, Sacha Nass and Claire Du Campe de Rosamel for the StatApp mandatory project from November 2024 to May 2025 (second year of engineering cycle at ENSAE IP Paris). 

**Subject : Analysis of the determinants of promotions in the french civil service.**

**Motivations** : The aim of this project is to focus on the career paths of civil servants (in France), to characterize them and to draw up a portrait of the measurable elements that play a role in whether or not they are promoted. Particular attention will be paid to socio-demographic variables (gender, age, place of residence).

**Methodology** : Career trajectories of individuals from certain State civil service corps between 1980 and 1989, and compare these trajectories with the various socio-demographic variables and job characteristics available. Oaxaca-Blinder decomposition was used to analyse gender gaps, complemented by clustering methods to identify distinct career profiles. Survival models, notably Cox regressions and frailty effect models, were applied to assess the determinants of promotion timing and to distinguish whether departments are structurally or contextually promotion-oriented. 

**Databases** : Files providing exhaustive and individual-level data on the employment and remuneration characteristics of civil servants in the French State civil service :
  - FGE (Fichiers généraux de l'Etat - general state files, Insee)
  - Siasp (Insee)

The report and summary sheet are currently only available in French.

**The underlying codes are not made available here due to the use of sensitive administrative data, but can be retrieved if required.**
