# StatApp
Econometrics and applied statistics project conducted under the supervision of @benjamingilbert (INSEE) with @manon, @sacha and @claire for the StatApp mandatory project from November 2024 to May 2025 (second year of engineering cycle at ENSAE IP Paris). 

**Subject : Analysis of the determinants of promotions in the french civil service.**

Motivations : The aim of this project is to focus on the career paths of civil servants (in France), to characterize them and to draw up a portrait of the measurable elements that play a role in whether or not they are promoted. Particular attention will be paid to socio-demographic variables (gender, age, place of residence).

Methodology : Career trajectories of individuals from certain State civil service corps between 1980 and 1989, and compare these trajectories with the various socio-demographic variables and job characteristics available. Duration models can be used to model the determinants of waiting time before a promotion. (key words : clustering method, duration models)

Databases : Files providing exhaustive and individual-level data on the employment and remuneration characteristics of civil servants in the French State civil service
